# GEOL0013_Python_Practical

This is a directory with a collection of routines for the practical of week 4 of GEOL0013 Principles of Climate

## Getting Started

All these jupyter notebook can be run on your laptop 

ERA5_Maps/Maps_fields_GEOL0013_T2m.ipynb will read and plot averages and trends of the 2m surface temperature 

ERA5_Maps/Maps_fields_GEOL0013_total_precipitation.ipynb will read and plot averages and trends of the total surface precipitation 

ERA5_Maps/EOFs_fields_GEOL0013_T2m.ipynb will perform EOF analysis of the 2m temperature

Sample data are contained in 

ERA5_Data/

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with downloading this directory you need to set up your environment and install anacond and basemap as described in those youtube tutorials

In order to download ERA5 data yourselves you will need to set up an account on ECMWF first and then follow the procedure described here 

https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadERA5datathroughtheCDSAPI

Alternatively you can download sample data and test some example scripts from a web interface here

https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox-editor/examples/02-plot-map

To use these python scipt on your machine you can download the cdstoolbox following the link below
https://pypi.org/project/cdstoolbox-remote/


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
